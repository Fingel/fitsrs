# CHANGELOG.md

## 0.3.0 (unreleased)

Features:

- BREAKING API change. Provide an iterator over the HDU list
- #16: Parsing of comments, history, continued, card as enum.
- BREAKING API change. `get` method on the Header object now takes a `&str` instead of a `[u8; 8]` slice.

Bugfixes:

- Be more safe about UB [https://github.com/cds-astro/fitsrs/issues/5]. BITPIX > 8 needs to be read from BigEndian scheme. It is thus necessary to create a new owned vector from the reading bytes. For BITPIX = 8, data can be directly read from the memory without allocating anything.
